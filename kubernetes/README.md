## Pre-installation Instructions
Prerequisites
* Please check the [resource requirements](https://github.com/netsil/manifests#prerequisites)
* Running kubernetes cluster
* Configured kubectl

## Installation
* Create ```netsil``` namespace
```
kubectl create -f netsil-ns.yaml 
```

* Create ```netsil``` replication controller
```
kubectl create -f netsil-rc.yaml 
```

* Create ```netsil``` service.
    
At this point you might want to modify ```netsil-svc.yaml``` to change the type of service to ```LoadBalancer``` if you are using a cloud provider plugin that supports load balancers or create an ```Ingress``` if you have an Ingress Controller.

```
# (possible warning to open ports)
kubectl create -f netsil-svc.yaml 
```

## Usage
Unless you have modified the port settings in the given service files, you can access Netsil through your master public IP on https, port 443. 

## Misc
### Host Network and Flannel
If you are using Flannel as your network overlay it is possible you might run into the following issue: 

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/20391

To work around this problem, you will want to run the following command on the host machines: 


iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o flannel.1 -s *host-private-ip* -j MASQUERADE


### Google Container Engine
If you are using Google Container Engine to provision your Kubernetes cluster, you may need to modify the volume host paths in `netsil-rc.yaml` (and `netsil.yml`, if you are using that manifest file).

The **hostPath** mount directives default to directories within `/opt/netsil`, but for certain operating systems provisioned by GKE, the `/opt` folder is read-only. Thus, you should change the `/opt/netsil` **hostPath** mount directives to a different path, like `/var/lib/netsil` for instance.
